# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1
## Isabel Foster 

## Installation 
The goal is to have a working Software Development Environment. Several of the required software
are already installed on my primary computer, so I've instead verified that they are working correctly
and are up to date. See section on verification.

I had to install both Maven and Git client. I experienced no issues using the provided links, and the 
installation was successful on both counts. 
I had to manually add Maven to path, but encountered no issues beyond that. 

### Verification 
To verify that the installation was successful and that the existing installations were up to date,
I ran some simple commands in the terminal to determine this. 
- javac -version 
  
>javac 16.0.2
  
- 
Confirmed tha this corresponds to the newest version


In particular, you should write about:
- technical problems that you encountered during installation of the software development environment and how you have solved them
- how you have validated (checked) that the software development environment is working
- technical problems encountered with the Heroku platform and how you solved them
- any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve
The hand-in should be written in English.
