# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1
### Isabel Foster 

## Installation 
The goal is to have a working Software Development Environment. Several of the required software
are already installed on my primary computer, so I've instead validated that they are working correctly
and are up to date. See section on validation.

I had to install both Maven and Git client. I experienced no issues using the provided links, and the 
installation was successful on both counts. 
I had to manually add Maven to path, but encountered no issues beyond that. 

## Validation 
To verify that the installation was successful and that the existing installations were up to date,
I ran some simple commands in the terminal to determine this.

### Java Development Environment (JDK): 
I verified that this is the correct, updated version.
```console
C:\Users\Isabel>javac -version
javac 16.0.2
```

### An Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
I use IntelliJ as my IDE. I confirmed that it's working correctly by creating and writing this file. 

### Maven software management tool:
```console
C:\Users\Isabel>mvn -version
Apache Maven 3.8.2 (ea98e05a04480131370aa0c110b8c54cf726c06f)
Maven home: C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.8.2
Java version: 16.0.2, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-16.0.2
Default locale: en_GB, platform encoding: Cp1252
OS name: "windows 10", version: "10.0", arch: "amd64", family: "windows"
```

### A Git client:
```console
C:\Users\Isabel>git --version
git version 2.33.0.windows.2
```

## Experiment: Heroku and Platform as a Service
I followed the steps in the heroku tutorial without issues. As I didn't want to provide payment information, I skipped
the Provision add-ons step og the tutorial. \

## Final notes
I did not experience any issues either during installation or during the tutorial.
