# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1
## Isabel Foster 

## Installation 
The goal is to have a working Software Development Environment. Several of the required software
are already installed on my primary computer, so I've instead verified that they are working correctly
and are up to date. See section on verification.

I had to install both Maven and Git client. I experienced no issues using the provided links, and the 
installation was successful on both counts. 
I had to manually add Maven to path, but encountered no issues beyond that. 

### Verification 
To verify that the installation was successful and that the existing installations were up to date,
I ran some simple commands in the terminal to determine this. 
- javac -version 
  
>javac 16.0.2

```console
C:\Users\Isabel>mvn -version
Apache Maven 3.8.2 (ea98e05a04480131370aa0c110b8c54cf726c06f)
