# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2
### Isabel Foster 

## Experiment 1 
### Part 1
For the first experiment I cloned the example project and followed the tutorial from step 4.3. 
I used the built-in database viewer in intellij to inspect databases and tables created. 
Running the main method of the example project produced the following results:

A table TODO was created, containing ID (primary key), description and summary columns. Running the method again 
added another instance (row) to the database.

### Part 2
As instructed in the tutorial, I created a new project, de.vogella.jpa.eclipselink. 
I did a few issues while trying to run the JUnit tests, continuously getting a javax.persistence error. 
In the end this was solved by updating openjdk. 
This resulted in the following tables being created:

With the relations between the entities as follows:
