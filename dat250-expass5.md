# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 5

## Experiment 1

Apparently my JAVA_HOME variable was not set up correctly, so my first attempt to build the project was
unsuccessful. Changing the path and restarting the application fixed the issue. 
It took a long time to download all the dependencies.

This was the result. The code can be found in the folder "demo" in the repository referenced at the
end of the report. 

## Experiment 2

I cloned the repository and followed the tutorial as instructed. 
Once again a long download after running the spring-boot command.
